  <summary>Find targets in a maze</summary>
  <description>
    <p>CuteMaze is a simple, top-down game in which mazes are randomly generated using one of a choice of several different algorithms. You move the character through the maze while hunting for targets (cheese, by default)â€”the game is won once all of these targets have been picked up.</p>
